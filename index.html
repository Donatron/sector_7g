              <h4>Drums / Random Acts of Weirdness</h4>
              <p>Arno has drumming in his blood from his father, who was a professional drummer and tutor. Drumming (guitaring/tromboning) from the age of 5, he has continued to play all percussion forms and has been  involved in active bands in Newcastle (while at the Newcastle Music Conservatorium), and Lismore NSW where he studied percussion at the Contemporary Souther Cross Uni. <br><br>
                The combination of Arno's technique, feel and passion for the world's variety of musical influences suits the tight knit and high energy feel of Sector 7G.
